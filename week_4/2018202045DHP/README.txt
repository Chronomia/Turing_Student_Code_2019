This is my fourth week's homework.
Intending to finish htmlparser.
It almost caters to all of the requirements.
Especially "tree structre" and "refer to http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/"

Unconutable special situations can't be solved. 
REALLY DIFFICULT but I tried qwqqqwq...

Till now, the page  "info.ruc.edu.cn" can be analyzed not that perfect but I think it's good. ...
But the page        "econ.ruc.edu.cn" emmmmmmm. ......

HTML is really free to write. 
"econ.ruc.edu.cn" has 465 grammer errors in Visual Studio Code.
I can't perfectly analyze it.
The Root Node is popped from the stack when dealing with that page.

This program:
    Analyze the page in "rooturl.txt".
    Construct the tree structure and output it into "tree.txt".
    Separate the page's information ito "title.out" "content.out" "link.out".

How to use
    make
    ./HP

That's it.
Time is really not enough so I haven't finished improving my last week's work.
